# WNBA API Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive set of API endpoints to provide rich WNBA data access, addressing the user's request for:
1. Stopping the display of team and player IDs instead of names
2. Providing more detailed statistics and views for the /game page
3. Adding endpoints for WNBA teams, standings, and players

## New Components Created

### 1. WNBA Service (`app/services/wnba.py`)
- **Purpose**: Business logic layer for WNBA data operations
- **Features**:
  - Team management (get all teams, by ID, by abbreviation)
  - Current standings with detailed records
  - Team rosters with player statistics
  - Team schedules and game results
  - Player game logs and statistics
  - League leaders in various categories
  - Player search functionality

### 2. WNBA API Router (`app/api/wnba.py`)
- **Purpose**: RESTful API endpoints for WNBA data
- **Endpoints**: 14 comprehensive endpoints covering:
  - Team information and statistics
  - League standings
  - Player detailed stats and game logs
  - League leaders
  - Player search and trending players

### 3. Lookup API Router (`app/api/lookup.py`)
- **Purpose**: Quick ID-to-name resolution service
- **Features**:
  - Batch team lookups
  - Batch player lookups
  - Combined batch lookups
  - Optimized for frontend name resolution

### 4. Enhanced Game Router (`app/api/game_router.py`)
- **Purpose**: Rich game page data
- **New Endpoint**: `/api/v1/games/{game_id}/enhanced`
- **Features**:
  - Full team names and logos instead of IDs
  - Complete player statistics with names
  - Team totals and shooting percentages
  - Game leaders identification
  - Sorted player lists (starters first)

### 5. Response Schemas (`app/api/schemas.py`)
- **Added**: 12 new Pydantic models for consistent API responses
- **Coverage**: Teams, standings, rosters, schedules, player stats, game logs, league leaders

## Key Benefits

### For Frontend Development

1. **Name Resolution**:
   - `/api/v1/lookup/teams?team_ids=1,2,3` → Get team names for IDs
   - `/api/v1/lookup/players?player_ids=456,789` → Get player names for IDs
   - `/api/v1/lookup/batch` → Get both teams and players in one request

2. **Rich Game Pages**:
   - Enhanced game endpoint provides everything needed for detailed game views
   - Team names, player names, statistics, and context all in one response
   - No more displaying raw IDs to users

3. **Comprehensive Statistics**:
   - Player detailed stats with advanced metrics (PER, true shooting %)
   - Team statistics and standings
   - League leaders in all major categories

### For User Experience

1. **No More ID Display**: All endpoints return human-readable names
2. **Detailed Game Views**: Rich statistics and context for game pages
3. **Player Discovery**: Search and trending player endpoints
4. **Real Statistics**: Advanced metrics for fantasy analysis

## Database Compatibility

The implementation is designed to work with the existing database structure:
- Gracefully handles missing WNBA team data (falls back to player.team_abbr)
- Works with current Player and StatLine models
- Compatible with existing Game and analytics structures

## API Design Principles

1. **RESTful**: Clear, predictable URL patterns
2. **Pagination**: Support for large datasets
3. **Filtering**: Query parameters for data filtering
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses
5. **Performance**: Optimized queries and batch operations

## Usage Examples

### Replace ID Display with Names
```javascript
// Before: showing "Team ID: 123"
// After:
const teams = await fetch('/api/v1/lookup/teams?team_ids=123').then(r => r.json());
console.log(teams[123].name); // "Las Vegas Aces"
```

### Rich Game Page
```javascript
// Get everything needed for game page
const gameData = await fetch('/api/v1/games/12345/enhanced').then(r => r.json());
// gameData.home_team.name, gameData.away_team.name
// gameData.home_team.players (with full stats)
// gameData.game_leaders (top performers)
```

### League Information
```javascript
// Current standings
const standings = await fetch('/api/v1/wnba/standings').then(r => r.json());

// League leaders
const scorers = await fetch('/api/v1/wnba/league-leaders?stat_category=points').then(r => r.json());
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `app/services/wnba.py` - WNBA business logic service
- `app/api/wnba.py` - WNBA API endpoints
- `app/api/lookup.py` - Lookup API endpoints
- `WNBA_API_ENDPOINTS.md` - Complete API documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified Files
- `app/api/__init__.py` - Added new routers
- `app/api/schemas.py` - Added new response models
- `app/api/game_router.py` - Added enhanced game endpoint

## Next Steps

1. **Data Population**: If WNBA team data is needed, it can be populated via the existing ingest system
2. **Frontend Integration**: Use the lookup endpoints to replace ID displays
3. **Game Page Enhancement**: Use the enhanced game endpoint for rich game views
4. **Performance Optimization**: Add caching if needed for frequently accessed data

The implementation provides a solid foundation for rich WNBA data access while maintaining compatibility with the existing system.
